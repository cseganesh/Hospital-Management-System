# Doctor Management System

## Project Overview
The **Doctor Management System** is designed to manage hospital operations such as doctor management, patient registration, appointment booking, and user login (admin, doctor, and patient). The system is built using Java Swing for the GUI, and MySQL for the database.

### Key Features:
- Admin, Doctor, and Patient login.
- Admin can manage doctors, view patient details, and handle appointments.
- Doctors can view their profiles, schedules, and manage appointments.
- Patients can register, book appointments, and view their appointment details.

## Technologies Used
- **Java (Swing)**: For building the user interface.
- **MySQL**: For database management.
- **JDBC**: For connecting the application to the database.
- **Prepared Statements**: For secure database interactions.

## Architecture Diagram
This system follows an **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture pattern:
- **Model**: Represents the database and database queries (MySQL, JDBC).
- **View**: Java Swing forms for interacting with the user.
- **Controller**: Handles business logic and interaction between the View and Model.

## Use Case Diagram
The use case diagram for this system includes three primary actors:
1. **Admin**: Can manage doctors and view patient details.
2. **Doctor**: Can view schedules and appointments.
3. **Patient**: Can register, log in, and book appointments.

## Conclusion

The Doctor Management System simplifies hospital operations by streamlining doctor management, patient registration, and appointment booking. It provides separate modules for admins, doctors, and patients, each tailored to their specific needs. The system is easy to use and maintain, and it ensures smooth interaction between users and the hospitalâ€™s data management.

Future developments could include more advanced features such as email/SMS notifications for appointments and integrating medical history management for patients, making it a more robust and comprehensive hospital management solution.

## Future Enhancements
- Add email and SMS notifications for appointment confirmations.
- Implement a search feature for patients to find doctors by specialization.
- Allow patients to view medical history and past appointments.
